OCX — OceanX Token (one-page)

What is OCX?
- OCX is the native token for OceanX. It powers in-game upgrades, rewards, and governance.
- Fixed supply: 1,000,000,000 OCX.

Why it matters
- Players use OCX to buy upgrades and scarce items, creating natural in-game demand.
- A portion of in-game OCX payments flows to the treasury and can be used for buybacks and burns to reduce circulating supply.

Key allocations
- Development: 20% (team — vested)
- Liquidity: 30% (LP wallet — initial liquidity + incentives)
- Marketing: 10% (campaigns, partnerships)
- Reserve: 40% (contract-locked supply for player claims and rewards)

How price can appreciate
- Utility-driven demand: more players and features that require OCX increase buy pressure.
- Supply management: burns, buybacks from revenue, and token locking reduce available supply.
- Liquidity & listings: robust liquidity and presence on Base DEXs lower slippage and improve trader confidence.

Immediate actions (first 60 days)
1. Set treasury to a multisig and publish signer information.
2. Lock a portion of LP tokens and announce the lock.
3. Start a 3-month LP incentive program funded from the LP wallet.
4. Publish vesting schedule for Development and Marketing allocations.
5. Add DEX router(s) and approved bridge(s) to `transferAgents` before listing.

Governance & roadmap
- Short-term: vesting, buyback plan, LP incentives, token sinks in-game.
- Mid-term: on-chain staking and governance, community proposals for treasury spending.

Contact & transparency
- Publish treasury statements monthly (spend, buybacks, remaining balance).
- Rotate and protect backend signer; consider hardware wallet + multisig for long-term keys.
