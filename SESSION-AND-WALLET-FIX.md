# Session and Wallet Connection Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ❌ Session Race Condition Console Warnings

**Problem:**
```
[GamePage] No client session found on first check — retrying shortly to avoid transient race
[GamePage] No client session found after retry; aborting client-side redirect to /auth to avoid redirect race with middleware
```

**Root Cause:**
- The `/game` page was trying to detect session issues on the client side
- It was implementing a retry mechanism to avoid races with middleware
- This caused unnecessary console warnings and complexity
- Middleware already protects the route, so these checks were redundant

**Solution:**
- Removed the session retry logic from `/game` page
- Simplified to directly use `getCurrentUser()` since middleware guarantees session exists
- If no user is found, redirect to `/auth` (edge case only)
- If no player record or no wallet, redirect to `/connect-wallet` instead of showing in-page prompt

### 2. ❌ MetaMask Not Triggering Connection Dialog

**Problem:**
- Users weren't seeing MetaMask popup when clicking "Connect Wallet"
- No clear feedback when MetaMask wasn't installed

**Root Cause:**
- `window.ethereum` check wasn't comprehensive enough
- Error messages were unclear
- No visual indicator when MetaMask was missing

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `connectWallet()` function with better checks:
  - Added `typeof window` check to ensure client-side execution
  - Better type checking for accounts array
  - Improved error messages with specific instructions
- Added visual warning on connect page when MetaMask not detected
- Added link to download MetaMask
- Disabled button when MetaMask not available

### 3. ❌ "No player data found" Error on /game Page

**Problem:**
- After clicking "Dive Deep" on `/home`, game page showed "No player data found"

**Root Cause:**
- Game page wasn't properly handling cases where:
  - Player record doesn't exist
  - Player exists but has no wallet
- It would show the error message instead of redirecting to wallet connection

**Solution:**
- Changed flow to redirect to `/connect-wallet` when:
  - No player record exists
  - Player exists but no wallet_address
- Removed the "walletPrompt" in-page state since `/connect-wallet` is the canonical place for this
- Clearer error handling with appropriate redirects

## Updated Flow

### Authentication & Game Access Flow

```
1. User signs in → /auth
   ↓
2. Auth successful → /auth/callback
   ↓
3. Session established → /connect-wallet (server component checks session)
   ↓
4a. No player record → Show "Connect Wallet" UI
4b. Player exists, no wallet → Show "Connect Wallet" UI  
4c. Player exists with wallet → Redirect to /home
   ↓
5. User on /home clicks "Dive Deep" → /game
   ↓
6. /game checks player data:
   - No player record → Redirect to /connect-wallet
   - No wallet → Redirect to /connect-wallet
   - Has wallet → Load game
```

### MetaMask Connection Flow

```
1. User on /connect-wallet (step = "connect")
   ↓
2. Page checks for window.ethereum
   - Not found → Show warning + download link + disable button
   - Found → Button enabled
   ↓
3. User clicks "Connect MetaMask"
   ↓
4. MetaMask popup appears (eth_requestAccounts)
   ↓
5a. User approves → Get wallet address
5b. User rejects → Show error "Please approve in MetaMask"
   ↓
6. Link wallet to user account in database
   ↓
7. Redirect to /home (or returnTo destination)
```

## Files Modified

### 2. `/app/connect-wallet/connect-wallet-client.tsx`
- ✅ Enhanced `connectWallet()` with better error handling
- ✅ Added type checking for accounts array
- ✅ Improved error messages
- ✅ Added MetaMask detection UI
- ✅ Added download link when MetaMask not installed
- ✅ Disabled button when MetaMask not available

### 3. `/middleware.ts`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Sign in with Google → Should land on /connect-wallet
- [ ] Click "Connect MetaMask" → MetaMask popup appears
- [ ] Approve MetaMask → Wallet linked, redirected to /home
- [ ] Click "Dive Deep" on /home → Game loads successfully
- [ ] No console warnings about session retries
- [ ] Player data loads correctly in game
- [ ] If MetaMask not installed → Warning shows with download link

## Expected Console Logs (Normal Flow)

```
[middleware] START /game at [timestamp]
[middleware] Session check took Xms for /game { hasSession: true, userId: '...' }
[GamePage] Component mounted
[GamePage] User authenticated, loading player data { userId: '...' }
[GamePage] Player data loaded successfully
```

## No More Warnings! ✅

The following warnings should NO LONGER appear:
- ❌ `[GamePage] No client session found on first check`
- ❌ `[GamePage] No client session found after retry`
- ❌ `[GamePage] No client user found; aborting client-side redirect`

## Additional Improvements

1. **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback when MetaMask is missing
2. **Better Error Messages**: More specific instructions for users
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed redundant session retry logic
4. **Consistent Flow**: All wallet connection happens on `/connect-wallet`
5. **Better Type Safety**: Added proper type checking for MetaMask responses

## Next Steps (If Issues Persist)

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Check MetaMask is unlocked**
3. **Check browser console for errors**
4. **Verify Supabase session in Application > Cookies**
5. **Check that player record exists in database with wallet_address**
