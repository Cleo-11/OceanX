## Expected Behavior ✅

### What Works Now
✅ Navigation from home page  
✅ Beautiful UI with animations  
✅ Search and filtering  
✅ Trade modal opens/closes  
✅ Amount selector works  
✅ OCX calculation updates  
✅ "Processing" animation  
✅ Resource amounts update after trade  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Hover effects  
✅ Smooth transitions  

### What's Simulated (Not Real Yet)
⚠️ Resource amounts (random mock data)  
⚠️ OCX balance (from player data or 0)

⚠️ Trade history (not persisted)  

**These will be real once you complete Phase 2 & 3!**

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Error: "Cannot find module"
**Solution**: Restart TypeScript server
```bash
# In VS Code
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

### Page Not Loading
**Solution**: Check if dev server is running
```bash
# Terminal should show
✓ Ready in 3.2s
```

### No Resources Showing
**Solution**: Check console for errors
```bash
# In browser
F12 → Console tab → Look for red errors
```

### Redirected to /auth
**Solution**: You need to be logged in
```bash
# Login first at
http://localhost:3000/auth
```

### No Wallet Connected
**Solution**: Connect wallet first
```bash
# You'll be prompted on /home page
# Connect MetaMask or other wallet
```
