## üêõ Common Issues to Watch For

### Fonts Not Loading

**Symptom:** Text still looks like Arial
**Fix:** 
1. Check internet connection (Google Fonts CDN)
2. Verify `@import` URL in globals.css is correct
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check DevTools Network tab for 404 errors

### Buttons Look Different

**Symptom:** Buttons don't match new styles
**Fix:**
1. Verify landing-page.tsx changes applied correctly
2. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart dev server
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Navigation Still Hidden

**Symptom:** Nav links have opacity-0 on load
**Fix:**
1. Check landing-page.tsx - should NOT have opacity-0 class
2. Verify the scrolled state condition
3. Clear browser cache

### Animations Janky

**Symptom:** Hover effects stutter or lag
**Fix:**
1. Check if old particle divs still exist (shouldn't be)
2. Verify GPU acceleration hints in CSS
3. Test on different browser
